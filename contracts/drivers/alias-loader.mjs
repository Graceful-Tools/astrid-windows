// Lets a driver import astrid-web modules that use the `@/…` path alias.
//
// `types/repeating.ts` imports nothing, so the repeating driver could load it directly. Almost
// everything else canonical — list-permissions, date-comparison, task-sort, the parser — imports
// `@/lib/...`, which Node cannot resolve on its own because the alias lives in astrid-web's
// tsconfig.
//
// Rather than build astrid-web (a Next.js build to read four pure functions) this registers a
// synchronous resolve hook that maps `@/x` onto `<webRoot>/x` and tries the extensions TypeScript
// would.
//
// TWO MODULES ARE STUBBED, and both stubs are deliberate:
//
//   @/lib/logger  — pulls in pino and its transports. The canonical functions only log behind a
//                   dev-only debug flag, so a no-op logger changes nothing they return.
//   @/lib/prisma  — opens a database connection at import time. Nothing a contract driver calls
//                   touches it; importing it for real would make fixture generation need a DB.
//
// A stub that silently changed behaviour would be a much worse problem than the build step it
// avoids, so each one is asserted as unused by the driver that relies on it: the fixtures are
// compared against web's real output, and a stub that mattered would show up as a wrong answer.
